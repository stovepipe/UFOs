# UFOs
Using JavaScript to build a table to display data using multiple filters. Final table will be embedded in an organized web page using html.

## Project Overview
The purpose of this project was to build a dynamic webpage that can format and display data with user inputs resulting in a filtered table of UFO Sightings. The table defaults to display all of the UFO Sightings data. A user can then filter the UFO Sightings data by date, city, state, country and shape. The filters may be combined to further narrow down the results.\

The table can be reset by clicking the "UFO Sightings" button in the upper left corner of the page.

## Results
This is the landing screen. Notice the full table of UFO Sightings data. The "UFO Sightings" button in the upper left of the screen will bring the user back to this landing screen when clicked.
